# Cereal Data Analysis
This repository contains R code for data visualization of cereal data.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is "cereal.csv". It contains information about various types of cereals and their nutritional content such as calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

# Dependencies
The following R packages are used in this code:
ggplot2

The R code for data visualization is contained in the file "cereal_data_visualization.R". It includes the following steps:
Importing the dataset
Checking and converting data types
Creating a frequency table for calorie count
Creating various plots for analyzing calorie count based on protein, fat, and ratings

# Plots
The following plots are created in this analysis:

Bar graph for calorie count  
Bar graph for calorie count by protein  
Bar graph for calorie count by fat  
Bar graph for calorie count by protein and fat  
Pie chart for calories ratio in fat  
Histogram for cereal rating distribution  
Box plot for calories by rating  
Density plot for rating by calorie, fat, and protein  

# Conclusion
From the plots, we can conclude that the calorie count of cereals varies based on their protein and fat content. Also, the cereal rating does not seem to have a direct correlation with the calorie count.

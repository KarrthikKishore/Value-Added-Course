# Cereal Data Analysis
This repository contains R code for data visualization of cereal data.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is "cereal.csv". It contains information about various types of cereals and their nutritional content such as calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

# Dependencies
The following R packages are used in this code:
ggplot2

The R code for data visualization is contained in the file "cereal_data_visualization.R". It includes the following steps:
Importing the dataset
Checking and converting data types
Creating a frequency table for calorie count
Creating various plots for analyzing calorie count based on protein, fat, and ratings

# Plots
The following plots are created in this analysis:

# Conclusion
From the plots, we can conclude that the calorie count of cereals varies based on their protein and fat content. Also, the cereal rating does not seem to have a direct correlation with the calorie count.
